# ðŸš€ MLOps_Practice

**MLOps_Practice** is a hands-on repository that explores the complete Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) lifecycle. It includes practical implementations of model versioning, deployment pipelines, automation, monitoring, and scaling strategiesâ€”bridging the gap between ML experimentation and production-ready systems.
